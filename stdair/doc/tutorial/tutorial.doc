This page contains some tutorial examples that will help you getting
started using StdAir. Most examples show how to construct some simple
business objects, i.e., instances of the so-named Business Object
Model (BOM).

The source code for these examples can be found in the
<tt>doc/tutorial/src</tt> directory. In that directory, there is also
a Make-file, named <tt>makefile.tutorial</tt>, allowing compiling all
the examples. Hence (\ref N), just go to the tutorial source
directory, and issue the following command:

\verbatim
make -f makefile.tutorial
\endverbatim

Examples of basic functionality:
- \ref tutorial01_rootobject
- \ref tutorial02_invobject
- \ref tutorial03_rootinvobject

More complete examples:
- \ref tutorial04_completeex

\note
\anchor N

(N) - The configuration script must have already been launched (at
least) once. To run the configuration script the first time, go to the
top directory (where the StdAir package has been un-packed), and issue
either of the following two commands, depending on whether the StdAir
project has been checked out from the Subversion repository or
downloaded as a tar-ball package from the Sourceforge Web site:
 - <tt>./autogen.sh</tt>
 - <tt>./configure</tt>
