Summary:
--------
StdAir aims at providing a clean API, and the corresponding C++
implementation, for the basis of Airline IT and travel distribution
Business Object Model (BOM), that is, to be used by several other open
source projects, such as AirRAC, RMOL, AirInv, AvlCal, AirSched, SimFQT,
SimLFS, SimCRS, TravelCCM, SEvMgr, TraDemGen, DSim, OpenTREP, etc.


Getting and installing from the Fedora/CentOS/RedHat distribution:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Just use Yum:
yum -y install stdair-devel stdair-doc

You can also get the RPM packages (which may work on Linux
distributions like Novel Suse and Mandriva) from the Fedora repository
(e.g., for Fedora 16, 
http://fr2.rpmfind.net/linux/fedora/releases/16/Everything/)


Building the library and test binary from Git repository:
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Sourceforge Git repository may be cloned as following:
git clone ssh://stdair.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/stdair/stdair stdairgit
cd stdairgit
git checkout trunk

Then, you need the following packages (Fedora/RedHat/CentOS names here, 
but names may vary according to distributions):
  * cmake
  * gcc-c++
  * boost-devel
  * readline-devel
  * soci-mysql-devel
  * zeromq-devel
  * python-devel
  * gettext-devel
  * doxygen
  * tetex-latex (optional)
  * rpm-build (optional)

Building the library and test binary from the tarball:
------------------------------------------------------
The latest stable source tarball (stdair*.tar.gz or .bz2) can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=267760

Then, as usual:
* To configure the project, type something like:
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/user/dev/deliveries/stdair-0.44.3 \
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug -DINSTALL_DOC:BOOL=ON ..
* To build the project, type:
  make
* To test the project, type:
  make check
* To install the library (libstdair*.so*) and the binary (stdair), just type:
  make install
  cd /home/user/dev/deliveries
  rm -f stdair-stable && ln -s stdair-0.44.3 stdair-stable
  cd -
* To package the source files, type:
  make dist
* To package the binary and the documentation:
  make package
* To run the local binary version:
  ./stdair/stdair -b
* To run the installed version (the first following line must be done once
  per session):
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/user/dev/deliveries/stdair-stable/lib
  /home/user/dev/deliveries/stdair-stable/bin/stdair -b
